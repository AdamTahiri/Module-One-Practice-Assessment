# Module-One-Practice-Assessment

Putting all your module 1 skills to the test!

---

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository.
1. Clone the forked repository to your computer.
1. `cd` to the cloned directory
1. `npm install` to install dependencies
1. `npm test` to run the tests

Read the prompts in each file in `/problems`. You can do the problems in any order you like. Run `npm test` after you attempt each problem to make sure your solution works.

> Note: You can run individual tests by passing the path of the test file to `npm test`. E.g. `npm test ./__tests__/everyOtherLetter.test.js` will only run that test file, reducing the amount of output.
